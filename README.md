## Mini-Project 9: Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation

### PURPOSE

This project is for a data engineering course (Mini-Project 9). The purpose of this project is to setup and effectively utilize a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment, with a specific emphasis on harnessing the capabilities of Google Colab. This project also executes diverse data manipulation tasks on a provided sample dataset.

Dataset: [Iris Dataset](https://gist.github.com/netj/8836201)

### PROCESS

To achieve the objectives of this project, the following steps are taken:

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   a. Access Google Colab via a web browser with Google accounts.  
   b. Create a new Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.  
   c. Configure the runtime settings for optimal performance.  

2. **Data Manipulation Tasks**
   a. Load the dataset into the Jupyter Notebook.  
   b. Explore the dataset's structure, data types, and basic statistics.  
   d. Perform data manipulation tasks such as filtering, sorting, and grouping the data.  
   e. Create visualizations using Matplotlib to convey insights from the data.  
   f. Conduct basic data analysis, including calculating summary statistics.
